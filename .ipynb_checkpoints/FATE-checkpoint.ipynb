    "# Debiasing Word Embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are Word Embeddings?\n",
    "\n",
    "Word Embeddings are the result of applying dimensionality reduction techniques to words!\n",
    "\n",
    "They give us dense representations of words, which we hope capture some syntactic and semantic information of the words. These dense representations are a natural tool for us to use if we want to pass words into neural models, and the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) has used some variants of Word Embeddings extensively.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many, many, many ways to build word embeddings, but the key intuition comes from the notion that the meaning of a word can by inferred from the types of words it appears next to, or as put by John Firth in 1975: \"You shall know a word by the company it keeps\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, we start with a large corpora of text. We'll use this copora to give us counts of words which occur next to each other, which is a pretty good start. In this matrix, our rows correspond to an \"embedding\" of sorts, where each word's embedding is a word by word count of the words that appear next to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's a hyperparameter, to choose how large of a window you use when considering words \"next to each other\", or if you want to do clever things, like weight each word by how distant it is from the word you're looking at.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's what a word co-occurence matrix looks like:\n",
    "<img src=\"./figs/word-co-occurrence.png\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 600px;\"/>\n",
    "<span style=\"font-size:9pt\">source:http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224u/materials/cs224u-vsm-overview.pdf</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "Each row now captures _something_ about the word it represents, in that words that appear in similar contexts will be closer together. Of course, they might not actually be _that_ close together, since our space is the size of our vocabulary.\n",
    "\n",
    "How big is our Vocabulary? Well, that's another hyperparameter. You can decide to filter out words that don't occur that often, to potentially get rid of noise, etc. But generally, it's going to be close to 300K or 400K. That means our word vectors are of dimension 400,000! Luckily, we can use dimensionality reduction techniques, like the ones you've seen already, to learn a low dimensional representation of this co-occurrence matrix. This will give us low-dimensional (200-300d), dense word vectors to use, so we can operate over them efficiently and pass them into models such as neural networks!\n",
    "\n",
    "Which dimensionality reduction technique should we use? Should we normalize counts? Convert them to probability distributions and minimize things like KL divergence? These are all design choices which can have a big effect on the quality and output of your word vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this assignment, though, we'll be using a very standard set of Word Embeddings, called GloVe (Global Vectors for Word Representations https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/) These word embeddings were standard in state of the art english NLP models, until very recently.\n",
    "\n",
